Image Feature Extraction Toolkit
A Comprehensive Computer Vision Library for Feature Extraction

OpenCV Python License

📌 Overview
This repository provides a production-ready toolkit for extracting 15+ types of visual features from images using traditional computer vision and deep learning methods. Designed for:
✔ Content-Based Image Retrieval
✔ Medical Image Analysis
✔ Object Recognition Systems
✔ Industrial Quality Control
